  /**A quadratic equation is something of the form
a⋅x² + b⋅x + c = 0 .
The values of x which satisfy this can be solved by using the equation
x = (-b ± sqrt(b² - 4⋅a⋅c)) / (2⋅a) .
Declare three constants named a , b and c of type double . Then calculate the two
values for x using the equation above (noting that the ± means plus or minus, so one
value of x for each). Store the results in constants called root1 and root2 of type double . */
