/*Programming Challenge 2

You are developing a fitness tracking application. The user inputs their daily steps and calories burned.
Your task is to calculate and display the following information:

1. Calculate the average steps per day for the week (7 days) and store it in a variable 'averageSteps'.
2. Calculate the total calories burned for the week and store it in a variable 'totalCalories'.
3. Determine the user's activity level based on the average steps:
   - If averageSteps is less than 5000, set the activity level to "Sedentary".
   - If averageSteps is between 5000 and 10000 (inclusive), set the activity level to "Moderate".
   - If averageSteps is greater than 10000, set the activity level to "Active".
4. Print the average steps, total calories, and activity level.

Use the following input data:
- Steps for each day: [8000, 7500, 9000, 6000, 11000, 12000, 9500]
- Calories burned for each day: [300, 280, 350, 240, 400, 420, 320]*/
